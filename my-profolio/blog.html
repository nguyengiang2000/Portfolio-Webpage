            <h1 class="blog-title">The Truth, Undiscovered!</h1>
            <h5>Author: Nguyen Giang - Posted in Oct 9, 2024 at 10:50 PM</h5>
            <h4>"Life is a mystery, a series of undiscovered truths. Human nature fears what remains hidden. Will you live in fear, or uncover the truth?"</h4>
            <p>Five days after the event in August 2052, two investigators—John McQueen, the nation's top private investigator, and Alana Brown, an FBI officer—along with a SWAT team, are summoned by the U.S. government to investigate an incident involving a bioweapon satellite. Their mission takes them to Florida, where they are tasked with investigating the satellite launch, gathering intelligence, and determining who is responsible. In addition, they must locate Dr. Murphy, a scientist specializing in biohazards, who is believed to be in hiding. Dr. Murphy's expertise could be crucial in developing a cure, and their mission includes safely escorting him to the U.S. military base in Washington, D.C.
                Upon arriving at the launch site, they find it in complete devastation. Buildings are reduced to rubble, and bodies—both deceased and infected—litter the area. After narrowly escaping death numerous times, they finally secure the necessary documents. However, the cost is high; several officers are killed, leaving only John, Alana, and three other team members.
                Their next objective is to find Dr. Murphy, who is believed to be hiding in The Villages. After enduring a week of peril, including battling through hordes of infected and losing more comrades, they discover Dr. Murphy hiding in the basement of a restaurant.
                As they prepare for evacuation, no rescue team arrives. Attempts to contact the base yield nothing but static and the faint beeping of radar interference. The situation is far worse than anyone initially believed. With rescue efforts compromised, John, Alana, and the remaining team are forced to shift their mission. Their primary goal now is to keep Dr. Murphy alive and survive as long as possible, hoping to eventually hear back from the base—or at least survive long enough to devise a new plan.

            <h1 class="blog-title">A Gang’s Redemption Amid the Chaos</h1>
            <h5>Author: Nguyen Giang - Posted in Oct 9, 2024 at 05:00 PM</h5>
            <h4>A man said "Once again, I find myself caught in a web of sin—but this time, those very sins may be the key to saving lives!"</h4>
            <p>In Dallas, Texas, 2052, the rain had been falling for hours, bringing devastation to everything it touched. Norman, former gangster, had long since turned his back on his past.
                 Once a member of the notorious Los Caídos gang, Norman had been drawn into a life of crime as a young orphan, eventually finding his way into the gang at just 16, under the mentorship of Arturo, an older gangster. 
                 His tough childhood and survival instincts made him a natural in the gang’s violent world. However, after serving time for aggravated assault, Norman decided to reform, finding stability in a job at Walmart and distancing himself from his dark past.
                 But that evening, things took a terrifying turn. After finishing his shift, Norman received an emergency alert warning of violent individuals attacking others. His friend Jeff, a bioweapons researcher, called him, urging Norman to stock up on supplies and stay safe. 
                 As chaos spread through the streets, Norman was forced to tap into his street-fighting skills to defend himself, but even those weren’t enough.
                  Just when things seemed most dire, Taylor—Norman’s childhood best friend—appeared and pulled him to safety. Taylor led Norman to a survivor camp called Brick House. Their newfound community is soon threatened by a hostile gang, Seninõ, led by the ruthless Miguel. When negotiations fail, a brutal battle ensues,
                 and Norman fights to protect his friends. Tragically, Taylor is killed while saving him, igniting a furious desire for revenge in Norman.
                After eliminating Miguel and defeating the gang, Norman, burdened by grief, decides to leave Brick House behind. With a horse gifted by the camp's leader, he sets out for Portland, determined to find his friend, Jeff to figure out what's going on with this world.</p>

            <h1 class="blog-title">Surviving the Rain: A Story of Family, Loss, and Revenge in a Post-Apocalyptic World</h1>
            <h5>Author: Nguyen Giang - Posted in Oct 9, 2024 at 04:30 PM</h5>
            <h4>Imagine a world where rain isn’t just water—it’s a deadly, infectious weapon turning people into violent, zombie-like creatures. 
                That’s the terrifying premise of Surviving the Rain, a gripping post-apocalyptic story about one girl’s fight for survival.</h4>
            <p>In 2052, amidst a torrential rain in Portland, Oregon, Mattie and her family are out shopping when chaos erupts in a store as a woman attacks a cashier. The woman, along with others, exhibits violent, zombie-like behavior, forcing Mattie's family to flee. As they reach their car, Mattie’s father is pulled away by an infected person and orders Mattie to drive away with her mother and brother, sacrificing himself to protect them. On their way home, they are hit by a car, flipping their vehicle. Mattie struggles to save her mother and brother from the wreck before being attacked by an infected dog. With quick thinking, she fends off the creatures and escapes to safety.

                After two days of hiding at home, with food supplies dwindling, Mattie ventures out alone to find food. At a store, she encounters more infected and narrowly escapes with supplies. She takes shelter from the rain in a nearby house and meets Martin, a former scientist who explains that the infection was caused by a failed U.S. government experiment with biological weapons deployed through satellites. The rain is now contaminated, turning both humans and animals into violent, infected beings. He warns her to stay away from the rain and the infected, whose eyes turn a milky yellow when infected.
                
                Mattie returns home, but five months later, their resources are running low again. She frequently visits Martin, helping him with tasks, but one day she finds his home ransacked and him murdered by a group called Vector—a violent, armed gang. She vows revenge after discovering that her mother and brother are also kidnapped by the gang. Mattie arms herself, surviving an attack at her home but getting wounded in the process. Left behind after being shot, she heals herself and prepares to hunt down Vector, determined to rescue her family.
                
                After several days, Mattie tracks the gang to Seattle, where their leader, Jack Martin, is using the Columbia Building as a base. Along the way, she encounters a couple of Vector members, kills one, and extracts information from the other about the gang's hideout. She learns that Vector operates like a military unit, controlling food and weapons supplies in the chaotic world post-infection. Using her survival skills and weapons, Mattie sets off toward Seattle, where she faces hordes of infected and heavily armed Vector patrols. She devises a plan to attack the gang and rescue her family, driven by the memory of her father's last stand and the hope of reuniting with her loved ones.
                
                In a climactic confrontation, Mattie infiltrates the Columbia Building, using stealth and combat tactics to eliminate her enemies. She becomes a hardened survivor, fueled by her loss and newfound resilience. The infection continues to spread, but Mattie’s journey has transformed her into a fierce warrior, committed to bringing justice to those who wronged her and saving what remains of her family in a broken, chaotic world.</p>
