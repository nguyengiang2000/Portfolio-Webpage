            <p>I was born and raised in a major city in Vietnam and moved to the United States in 2019. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a strong interest in Cybersecurity. My passion for Cybersecurity began in high school, where I explored various ethical hacking tools and developed a deep understanding of the field. Technology has always been a powerful force in shaping the world, and I am fascinated by its ability to transform industries and improve everyday life.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Beyond technology, I have a diverse range of hobbies. In my free time, I engage in creative pursuits such as drawing, writing stories, photography, and playing guitar. These artistic outlets complement my technical skills by fostering creativity and attention to detail.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>Additionally, I am an avid basketball player and have been playing the sport for over five years, honing both my physical and mental discipline through regular practice and competitive games.</p>
