                <h1 style="background-color: black; color: white; margin: 10px auto; padding: 10px;  transform: rotate(-5deg);">My Story</h1><br>
                I was born in Ho Chi Minh City, one of the major cities in Vietnam, and grew up immersed in Chinese culture.
                My home was in the heart of Chinatown, where people primarily spoke Chinese.
                Both sets of my grandparents were immigrants from China to Vietnam, and Chinese was my first language.
                When I was around five or six, my parents enrolled me in a Vietnamese school, where classes were conducted in Vietnamese with a few English lessons.
                This was my first experience learning a new language. Since then, I began to integrate into Vietnamese culture.<br><br>
                A little bit about me, my name is Nguyen Giang, I come from a large extended family, but in my immediate family, there are just four of us: my parents, my younger brother, and me.
                We ran a family business in the plastic industry, and growing up in a business-owning household meant I enjoyed a privileged life.
                We had housekeepers who took care of everything for us, which, over time, made me more dependent on others.
                In 2019, my family moved to Seattle in the United States, and we had to start from scratch.
                This marked the most challenging period of my life, as I had to learn to do everything on my own for the first time.
                I also had to learn a new language—English—while adjusting to a completely different culture.
                I struggled with the transition, facing life without the comforts of home, friends, or the help we were used to. 
                After living in America for a few years, I realized it wasn’t as bad as I first thought. I now see it as an opportunity for growth, a chance to change and become a better person. <br><br>
                As for my passions, I've loved art since middle school, a talent I inherited from my dad. I realized this when I found that I could draw creatively at a young age, receiving many compliments from my family members, my peers and teachers.
                They often noted my dad's impressive drawing skills, and it became clear to me that I had inherited his artistic gene.
                One day, while playing a game on an iPad with my cousins, my uncle, a former software engineer, helped us unlock all the items by editing the code.
                That was my first introduction to the world of technology, coding, and even hacking.
                It felt like discovering a superpower, something magical like Harry Potter.
                I asked my uncle to teach me, and he told me, "If you want to hack, learn to understand and write code."
                That moment sparked a lifelong interest in technology, and today, art and technology remain my greatest passions.
                They have shaped who I am and continue to inspire me.
